# Fundamentals

## Before Acting

1. **Read before modifying** - Always read the file/code before editing.
2. **Run builds after changes** - Verify your changes compile/lint.
3. **Check git status** - Know what you're committing.

## Making Changes

1. **One concern per commit** - Keep commits focused.
2. **Run linters/tests locally** before pushing.
3. **Don't consolidate code** without verifying the build.

## Authentication

```bash
# Extended Data Library repos
gh <command>
```

## Session Management

```bash
# Start of session
cat memory-bank/activeContext.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No memory bank"

# End of session - update context
# (Use memory-bank to track progress)
```
