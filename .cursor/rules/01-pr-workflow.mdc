# PR Workflow

## Creating PRs

1. **One feature/fix per PR** - Keep scope minimal.
2. **Clear title**: `type(scope): description`.
3. **Body explains** WHAT, WHY, and HOW.

### Conventional Commit Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `test` | Adding tests |

## AI Peer Review

**ALWAYS request AI reviews on PRs:**

```
/jules review
/cursor review
```

## Merging

- ✅ Wait for CI to pass.
- ✅ Address all review comments.
- ✅ Squash if commits are messy.
- ❌ Never use `--admin` to bypass checks.
